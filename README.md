# About Quicktext Query Language

The [***Quicktext Query Language***](http://www.quicktext.org) is called [***QQL***](http://www.quicktext.org) for short. 

On the other hand, the ***Structure Query Language*** (***SQL***) is a widely used programming language in the database.

The ***QQL*** is a domain-specific language oriented to the ***corpus processing***, while the ***SQL*** is oriented to the ***data processing***.

Although the corpus processing belongs to the data processing, yet there are many differences in the processing.

The principle of the QQL is under the ***CAP*** theory while the principle of the SQL is under the ***ACID*** theory.
